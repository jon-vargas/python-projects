# python-projects

## Introduction

The goal of this repo is to serve as a showcase of python projects I've finished and/or currently working on. Additionally, I want this to also establish an overall level of understanding. With each upload, I'll also include a breakdown of what the code is there to achieve with pros and cons to the approach. There will be more detailed line-by-line breakdowns in the code as well. Thanks for stopping by and stay tuned for updates
