# python-projects

## Introduction

The goal of this repo is to serve as a showcase of Python projects I've finished and/or currently working on. Additionally, I hope this will display an established knowledge of concepts and principles. With each upload, I'll also include a breakdown of what the code is there to achieve with pros and cons to the approach. There will be more detailed line-by-line comment breakdowns in the code as well.

The topics of my projects will vary. I'm simply following my particular interests and exploring ways to do some analysis around them. For example, I enjoy staying up-to-date with our economy and the stock market, this began my intrigue in utilizing FRED's API to extract economic data. I'm a big fan of watching TV shows and movies, so I chose to analyze my own Netflix viewing data - Netflix allows you to download all your own personal data, really awesome for analysis. Next in line, I'm curious to see if I can do something similar with my own Spotify data. I love music and have had a Spotify account for quite some time. I think there'll be a substantial amount of data there to analyze - I may even discover some neat insights regarding my own music trends over the years. I think you get the gist, that is all for now. Good day!
